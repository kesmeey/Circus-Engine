/** Where a D.C.III build keeps each kind of scene surface.

 *  The three builds that share the DD host compile the same scene structure from the same
 *  sources, but each one lays the logical image slots out differently: D.C.III D.D. gives
 *  the cast ten slots and puts the shared UI surfaces at 36, With You gives it eight and
 *  puts them at 28, P.P. gives it eight and puts them at 21 - and the scripts address each
 *  surface by its own build's number, so none of these ranges can be inherited.

 *  The values come from the resources each build's own scripts load into the slots: the
 *  cast takes BST\, the portrait FACE\, the petal sheet the sakura effect, the fog layer
 *  the fog effect, the wipe mask MSK\, and the UI surfaces are the ones its UI quads ask
 *  for and its release loop spares - DC3DD keeps 36..42 (424100) and DC3WY keeps 28..34
 *  (41EBA6), both checked against the executable.
