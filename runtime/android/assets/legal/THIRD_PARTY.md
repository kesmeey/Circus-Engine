# Sources and attribution

This repository contains static analysis tools, a portable Java core, and an
Android development host. It is distributed under GPL-3.0-only; the
full license is in `LICENSE`. Game data is not part of the source distribution.

## MesTextTool

- Author/project: cokkeijigen and MesTextTool contributors.
- License: GNU GPL version 3, see the upstream LICENSE.
- https://github.com/cokkeijigen/MesTextTool
- Format catalog: `MesTextTool/src/mes/script_info.cpp`.
- Header/framing reference: `MesTextTool/src/mes/script_view.cpp`.
- `profiles/dc123.json` is generated from the local source by
  `tools/import_profiles.py`; its source SHA-256 is recorded in the catalog.
- Only DC1/2/3 and related fandisc entries are imported. The framing table does
  not establish opcode execution semantics or compatibility with a full game.

## GARbro

Archive readers, media metadata readers, and Java CRX/CRXD/XPCM decoding algorithms
were implemented or adapted with reference to:

- https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/blob/master/ArcFormats/Circus/ArcPCK.cs
- https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/blob/master/ArcFormats/Circus/ArcCRM.cs
- https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/blob/master/ArcFormats/Circus/ImageCRX.cs
- https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/blob/master/ArcFormats/Circus/ImageCRXD.cs
- https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/blob/master/ArcFormats/Circus/AudioPCM.cs

`XpcmTransform.java` ports the integer FFT and overlap/add transform in AudioPCM.cs, including mode 1/3 decoding. Synthetic nonzero vectors were compared byte for byte against the independent C# implementation. The full MIT notice is also retained in that source file.

The following notice is retained for the referenced/adapted format algorithms:

## PL_MPEG

The vendored `runtime/native/third_party/pl_mpeg.h` provides MPEG-1 video and
MPEG Layer II audio decoding. Source: https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_mpeg,
upstream Git blob `b42f53f89f868a697435ab1e15742f370819ffbc`, retrieved 2026-10-26.
The header identifies its author as Dominic Szablewski (https://phoboslab.org)
and declares `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`.

Local audio corrections (2026-10-28): dequantize using the number of quantizer
levels instead of levels + 1, and normalize the synthesis output by 2^30.
The original constants produced subband-dependent attenuation and an extra
64/65 output gain. See `docs/ANDROID_0126.md` for independent PCM comparisons.

## Other evaluated projects (references only)

- https://github.com/Atho64/arisa32 — MIT; DC4-specific runtime, useful as a
  research reference but not imported into this DC1/2/3 core project.
- https://github.com/lifegpc/msg-tool — optional independent format cross-check.
- https://github.com/xmoezzz/ethornell-rs and https://github.com/xmoezzz/rfvp —
  different engines; architecture references only, no runtime code imported.

## Build and development tools

- Android SDK / D8 / AAPT / APK signer: existing local installation, not redistributed.
  https://developer.android.com/build/building-cmdline
  https://developer.android.com/tools/d8
- Android Storage Access Framework:
  https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/documents-files
- Frida (optional, installed only under ignored build/probe-python): local observation
  of an explicitly authorized isolated process, never embedded in the APK.
  https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/

The launcher logo in `runtime/android/res/drawable-nodpi/launcher_logo.png` was
supplied by the user on 2026-10-26 for use as this APK's icon. It is retained
unchanged (SHA-256 `9eeac6a9b61ac25eb3635b45f0052b2ef6a5f7b2d38cef337337f2d80a259361`).
It is separate artwork, not covered by the core code's GPL license declaration.

The synthetic assets in runtime/android/assets/demo are generated by
tools/generate_demo.py. Apart from the explicitly supplied launcher artwork,
no game images, dialogue, audio, executable, fonts, or dynamic-probe copy should
be included in source/APK redistribution.

## REA analysis reference (2026-10-27)

REA (`https://github.com/morluto/rea`), MIT, copyright 2026 morluto, is used as a separately installed static analysis tool. Reference checkout: `624ebb2a1e633ce14b6d6828eef50bf7d7db68ac`; executed npm package: `rea-agents@6.8.0`, with project-local Ghidra 12.1.4. No REA source is embedded in the engine or distributed source package. The checkout and its LICENSE remain in `build/references/rea`; provider binaries and their own notices remain under `build/toolchain` and are excluded from distribution.

## PC distribution components

The local Windows PC test package contains a jlink image built from Eclipse Temurin
OpenJDK 21.0.9+10. Its module license files are retained under `jre/legal`, and the
vendor notice is retained as `JRE-NOTICE`. https://adoptium.net/temurin/

FFmpeg is used as a separate command-line decoder process. The local executable is
`7.1-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev`, obtained from the existing imageio-ffmpeg
installation. Its exact configuration and hash are recorded in `FFMPEG-BUILD.txt`
and `BUILD.json`. This build declares GPL version 3 or later; the full GPL text
is included as `LICENSE`. Upstream: https://ffmpeg.org/ and
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ . No FFmpeg or JRE files are copied into the
project's source ZIP; the PC packager accepts user-provided toolchain paths.

## Unity FSB5 Vorbis setup headers

`runtime/core/resources/org/circus/core/fsb5-vorbis-headers.bin.gz` contains the
161 codec setup packets from HearthSim/python-fsb5, converted from its Python
dictionary into a compact binary table. These are public codec configuration
headers, not game audio. Original file SHA-256:
`abb2a177ddad75d4c42f8c19ae20cd86be4145761ff40881136a13652dd3aa70`.
Retrieved 2026-10-29 from
https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5/blob/master/fsb5/vorbis_headers.py .
The FSB5 container documentation and reconstruction reference are from the same
project. The runtime Ogg writer and bounded readers are implemented in Java.
